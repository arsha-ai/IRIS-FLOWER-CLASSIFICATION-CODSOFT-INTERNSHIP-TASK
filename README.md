# Iris Flower Classification - codsoft internship task

This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. It uses Support Vector Classification (SVC) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel and includes various data visualizations.


## Features

- Data preprocessing using sklearn
- Support Vector Classification model for prediction
- Interactive command-line interface for user input
- Probability-based species predictions
- Data visualizations including PCA, box plots, and violin plots



## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
##  Installation

-  Clone this repository: https://github.com/arsha-ai/IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION-CODSOFT-INTERNSHIP-TASK.git

-  Navigate to the project directory: cd iris-classification

- Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt


## Running the model

Run the model with the given dataset 'IRIS.csv' and add your directory to the model to execute the code sucessfully.
